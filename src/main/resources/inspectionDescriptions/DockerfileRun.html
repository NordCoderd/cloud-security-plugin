<p>Detects various issues in Dockerfiles that could lead to security vulnerabilities, package management inefficiencies,
    and bloated image sizes. Addressing these issues enhances the security, maintainability, and efficiency of Docker
    images.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unsafe ARG in RUN</strong>: Using ARG variables in RUN commands can be overridden by users, leading to
        unintended behaviors or security risks.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Curl Bashing</strong>: Detects the use of curl or wget with pipes or redirections to execute scripts
        from untrusted sources, preventing the execution of potentially harmful scripts.
    </li>
    <li><strong>'apt-get dist-upgrade' Used</strong>: Avoids using 'apt-get dist-upgrade' in Dockerfiles, as it performs
        major version upgrades which are inappropriate for Docker images.
    </li>
    <li><strong>'apt-get' Missing '-y'</strong>: Ensures 'apt-get' commands include the '-y' flag to avoid manual user
        input during package installations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>'zypper clean' Missing</strong>: Ensures that cached package data is cleaned after using zypper to
        reduce image size.
    </li>
    <li><strong>RUN Package-Manager Update Alone</strong>: Ensures that 'RUN &lt;package-manager&gt; update'
        instructions are not used alone and are followed by install commands in the same RUN statement to prevent
        orphaned packages.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Missing dnf Clean</strong>: Ensures 'dnf clean all' is used after 'dnf install' commands to clean
        package caches and reduce image size.
    </li>
    <li><strong>'yum clean all' Missing</strong>: Ensures 'yum clean all' is used after 'yum install' commands to clean
        package caches and reduce image size.
    </li>
    <li><strong>RUN cd ...</strong>: Encourages the use of WORKDIR instead of 'RUN cd ...' commands to change
        directories, improving readability and maintainability.
    </li>
</ul>
