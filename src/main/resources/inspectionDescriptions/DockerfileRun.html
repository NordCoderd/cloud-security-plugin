<p>Detects unfollowing of best practices for RUN commands.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use `--no-install-recommends` with `apt-get` to avoid installing unnecessary packages and reduce image size.</li>
    <li>Avoid using ARG variables in RUN commands to prevent unintended behaviors or security risks.</li>
    <li>Avoid using `curl` or `wget` with pipes or redirections to execute scripts from untrusted sources.</li>
    <li>Do not use `dist-upgrade` as it upgrades major versions unnecessarily in Dockerfiles.</li>
    <li>Ensure package caches are cleaned after installation using `dnf clean all`.</li>
    <li>Ensure package caches are cleaned after installation using `yum clean all`.</li>
    <li>Ensure package caches are cleaned after installation using `zypper clean`.</li>
    <li>Use the `-y` flag with package managers to avoid manual user input.</li>
    <li>Follow `RUN &lt;package-manager&gt; update` with `install` in the same RUN statement to prevent orphaned packages.</li>
    <li>Avoid using `RUN` with `sudo` commands to prevent unpredictable behavior.</li>
    <li>Use `WORKDIR` instead of `RUN cd ...` to change directories for better readability and maintainability.</li>
    <li>RUN using 'wget' and 'curl'</li>
</ul>
