ds001.latest-tag=':latest' tag used\nWhen using a 'FROM' statement you should use a specific tag to avoid uncontrolled behavior when the image is updated.
ds001.missing-version-tag=Missing version tag\nWhen using a 'FROM' statement you should use a specific tag to avoid uncontrolled behavior when the image is updated.
ds002.root-user-is-used=Image user should not be 'root'\nRunning containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation.
ds002.missing-user=User should be declared, often by default it is root\nRunning containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation.
ds003.ssh-port-exposed=Port 22 exposed\nExposing port 22 might allow users to SSH into the container.
ds004.add-instead-copy=ADD instead of COPY\nYou should use COPY instead of ADD unless you want to extract a tar file.
ds005.copy-referring-to-the-current-image=COPY '--from' referring to the current image\nCOPY '--from' should not mention the current FROM alias, since it is impossible to copy from itself.
ds006.multiple-entrypoint=Multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions listed\nThere can only be one ENTRYPOINT instruction in a Dockerfile.
ds007.port-out-of-range=Exposed port {0} out of range\nUNIX ports outside the range 0-65535 are exposed.
ds008.workdir-path-not-absolute=WORKDIR path not absolute\nFor clarity and reliability, you should always use absolute paths for your WORKDIR.
ds009.run-using-sudo=RUN using 'sudo'\nAvoid using 'RUN' with 'sudo' commands, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior.
ds010.use-slash-for-copy-args=COPY with more than two arguments not ending with slash\nWhen a COPY command has more than two arguments, the last one should end with a slash.
ds011.no-duplicate-alias=Duplicate aliases defined in different FROMs\nDifferent FROMs can't have the same alias defined.
ds012.use-workdir-over-cd='RUN cd ...' to change directory\nUse WORKDIR instead of proliferating instructions like 'RUN cd ? && do-something', which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain.
ds013.standardise-remote-get=RUN using 'wget' and 'curl'\nAvoid using both 'wget' and 'curl' since these tools have the same effect.
ds014.purge-yum-package-cache='yum clean all' missing\nYou should use 'yum clean all' after using a 'yum install' command to clean package cached data and reduce image size.
ds015.only-one-cmd=Multiple CMD instructions listed\nThere can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.
ds016.no-orphan-package-update='RUN <package-manager> update' instruction alone\nThe instruction 'RUN <package-manager> update' should always be followed by '<package-manager> install' in the same RUN statement.
ds017.purge-dnf-package-cache='dnf clean all' missing\nCached package data should be cleaned after installation to reduce image size.
ds018.purge-zipper-cache='zypper clean' missing\nThe layer and image size should be reduced by deleting unneeded caches after running zypper.
ds019.use-apt-auto-confirm='apt-get' missing '-y' to avoid manual input\n'apt-get' calls should use the flag '-y' to avoid manual user input.
ds020.no-maintainer=Deprecated MAINTAINER used\nMAINTAINER has been deprecated since Docker 1.13.0.
ds021.only-one-healthcheck=Multiple HEALTHCHECK defined\nProviding more than one HEALTHCHECK instruction per stage is confusing and error-prone.
ds022.no-dist-upgrade='apt-get dist-upgrade' used\n'apt-get dist-upgrade' upgrades a major version so it doesn't make more sense in Dockerfile.
# Not implemented
ds023.multiple-exposed-port=Port {0} exposed more than one time.
ds024.wrong-port-definition=Port {0} is incorrect.
