# QuickFixes
ds001.lookup-for-digest=Look up and replace with digest

# Localization
ds001.latest-tag=':latest' tag used. When using a 'FROM' statement you should use a specific tag to avoid uncontrolled behavior when the image is updated.
ds001.missing-version-tag=Missing version tag. When using a 'FROM' statement you should use a specific tag to avoid uncontrolled behavior when the image is updated.
ds002.root-user-is-used=Image user should not be 'root'. Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation.
ds002.missing-user=User should be declared, often by default it is root. Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation.
ds003.ssh-port-exposed=Port 22 exposed. Exposing port 22 might allow users to SSH into the container.
ds004.add-instead-copy=ADD instead of COPY. You should use COPY instead of ADD unless you want to extract a tar file.
ds005.copy-referring-to-the-current-image=COPY '--from' referring to the current image. COPY '--from' should not mention the current FROM alias, since it is impossible to copy from itself.
ds006.multiple-entrypoint=Multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions listed. There can only be one ENTRYPOINT instruction in a Dockerfile.
ds007.port-out-of-range=Exposed port {0} out of range. UNIX ports outside the range 0-65535 are exposed.
ds008.workdir-path-not-absolute=WORKDIR path not absolute. For clarity and reliability, you should always use absolute paths for your WORKDIR.
ds009.run-using-sudo=RUN using 'sudo'. Avoid using 'RUN' with 'sudo' commands, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior.
ds010.use-slash-for-copy-args=COPY with more than two arguments not ending with slash. When a COPY command has more than two arguments, the last one should end with a slash.
ds011.no-duplicate-alias=Duplicate aliases defined in different FROMs. Different FROMs can't have the same alias defined.
ds012.use-workdir-over-cd='RUN cd ...' to change directory. Use WORKDIR instead of proliferating instructions like 'RUN cd ? && do-something', which are hard to read, troubleshoot, and maintain.
ds013.standardise-remote-get=RUN using 'wget' and 'curl'. Avoid using both 'wget' and 'curl' since these tools have the same effect.
ds014.purge-yum-package-cache='yum clean all' missing. You should use 'yum clean all' after using a 'yum install' command to clean package cached data and reduce image size.
ds015.only-one-cmd=Multiple CMD instructions listed. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.
ds016.no-orphan-package-update='RUN <package-manager> update' instruction alone. The instruction 'RUN <package-manager> update' should always be followed by '<package-manager> install' in the same RUN statement.
ds017.purge-dnf-package-cache='dnf clean all' missing. Cached package data should be cleaned after installation to reduce image size.
ds018.purge-zipper-cache='zypper clean' missing. The layer and image size should be reduced by deleting unneeded caches after running zypper.
ds019.use-apt-auto-confirm='apt-get' missing '-y' to avoid manual input. 'apt-get' calls should use the flag '-y' to avoid manual user input.
ds020.no-maintainer=Deprecated MAINTAINER used. MAINTAINER has been deprecated since Docker 1.13.0.
ds021.only-one-healthcheck=Multiple HEALTHCHECK defined. Providing more than one HEALTHCHECK instruction per stage is confusing and error-prone.
ds022.no-dist-upgrade='apt-get dist-upgrade' used. 'apt-get dist-upgrade' upgrades a major version so it doesn't make more sense in Dockerfile.
ds025.arg-in-user=User should be static. Dynamic user assignment can be overridden to root, risking container escape.
ds026.possible-secrets-in-env=Potential secret in ENV key found: {0}
ds027.avoid-curl-bashing=Curl bashing detected. Avoid using curl or wget with pipe (|) or redirection (>) to directly execute scripts from untrusted sources.
ds028.avoid-arg-in-run=Using ARG variables in RUN commands can be overridden by users, leading to unintended behaviors or security risks.
ds030.use-no-install-recommends=Use --no-install-recommends with apt-get to avoid installing unnecessary packages and reduce image size.
# Not implemented
ds023.multiple-exposed-port=Port {0} exposed more than one time.
ds024.wrong-port-definition=Port {0} is incorrect.
ds029.missing-healthcheck=Missing HEALTHCHECK instruction
